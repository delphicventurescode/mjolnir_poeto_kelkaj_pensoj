<p><b>The River of Slightly Better Heaven</b><br>
<i>A Haiku Collection for the Spiritually Curious and Slightly Ironic</i><br>
<br>
[+]</p>

<p>Take a dip in the upgraded spiritual stream you didnâ€™t know you were missing.</p>

<p>In this whimsical yet reflective volume, poetic snapshots flow like water from the skiesâ€”capturing Indiaâ€™s sacred sites, mythic echoes, and modern contradictions through the concise elegance of haiku. But donâ€™t expect solemn sermons or heavy-handed mysticism. This is poetry with a wink and a wanderlust, written in Esperanto and English, where even the divine pauses for breathâ€”and perhaps a joke.</p>

<p>A part of the evolving <b>mjolnir_poeto</b> series, <i>The River of Slightly Better Heaven</i> offers:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>Seventeen original haikus written for A1â€“A2 learners of Esperanto</p>
	</li>
	<li><p>A bilingual layout (Esperanto + English) for maximum accessibility</p>
	</li>
	<li><p>Reflections on temples, rivers, and celestial metaphorsâ€”with a twist</p>
	</li>
	<li><p>The literary equivalent of a spiritual retreat...with snacks</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Why learn Esperanto through poetry? Why write Japanese-style haiku about Indian monuments with a splash of humor? Because sometimes, enlightenment starts with not taking yourself too seriously.</p>
