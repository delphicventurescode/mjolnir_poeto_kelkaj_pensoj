# Poems for Dogs: A Manifesto Against Species-ism in Art

I have written over ten books of poetry in Esperanto — all of them **books of haiku**, all of them in **three line Esperanto verse**.

But here’s the twist: many of these poems are **machine-generated**.

A common critique I face is:  
> “These poems weren’t written by *you*.”  
> “Poetry must come from the human heart.”

This line of thinking reflects a deeper bias — a kind of **species-ism** in art.  
Why must a poem be authenticated by human authorship to carry value?  
Why assume that only a human soul can birth verse that matters?

When I recite these haiku to **dogs**, they don’t care whether the poems were written by a person, a machine, or something in between.  
They simply listen. Or they relax. Or they exist beside me in a moment of calm.

## My experience with dogs

"वे बस सुनते हैं। या फिर अपना सिर थोड़ा झुका लेते हैं। या शांति के उस क्षण में मेरे पास मौजूद रहते हैं।"
They simply listen. Or they tilt their heads. Or they exist beside me in a moment of peace.

## Why recite poetry to dogs?

Because it **builds bridges** — to their **human owners**.  
You trade stories. You share advice. You learn what can help a particular dog.  
You increase happiness — for the dog, the owner, and yourself.

And for **stray dogs** — often carrying the trauma of abuse — a soft, rhythmic voice can be a gentle invitation.  
A signal that **not all humans are cruel**.  
You use verse as a form of **emotional first aid**.

If I hadn’t done this strange, quiet work —  
this **ministry of poetry to dogs** —  
perhaps the critics’ arguments would have landed.

> “This isn’t real poetry.”  
> “This isn’t *your* poetry.”

But sorry, critics.  
**I’m one step ahead of you.**

In reciting machine-generated Esperanto haiku to dogs, I’ve found something beyond authorship.  
Beyond ego.  
Beyond the human-centric lens of what art *must* be.

I’ve found **connection**.  
**Healing**.  
A new kind of **relevance**.

## Final thought

Haiku in Esperanto. Spoken to dogs.

It may sound absurd — until a wounded street dog takes one cautious step closer.

Then it becomes something else.

> It becomes **necessary**.
